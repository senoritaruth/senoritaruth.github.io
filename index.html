		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
		<p>Hi, I'm Ruth. I help creatives establish their online identity and presence so they can participate in the creative economy to their fullest potential. I do so by deisnging websites and teaching about social media management. Have you ever purchased art from the artist from their website or through a social media post?

		<p>My life as a content creator has always had a shoestring, DIY apporach. The point-and-shoot reflects this genesis. In 3 years, I'd like to be able to provide high-quality, thorough web development services to the same community as I serve now, and the 2nd pic reflects the more in-depth approach to doing so.</p>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Week 0</h3>
		<p>Orientiation was very interesting. I was happy to touch base with some of the faces behind the keyboard from the pre-work portion, and listen to everyone else's introduction. I like that we have students from a variety of backgrounds and with wildly different motivations for joining this experience.</p>

		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>The first week was grueling. I experienced some obstacles that were completely unexpected, but I have really enjoyed connecting with my peers. We're all very smart and funny, and I enjoy my classmates' contribution. I feel there is a lot of potential for us to help each other a lot, not only technically, but also in terms of motivation and follow-through. The AI talk on Friday was fun, and I liked the fact that it was lead by a CNM board member. </p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>Made it through the first crucible. I am so proud of my cohort. No one in this group goes down without a fight. We're all punching up and mostly swinging in the dark, but it feels like all of us are somehow powered by the challenge. I look forward to more with this group, and I'm rooting for every single one of us.</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<p>Working in teams is always a new and exciting experience. I am flattered by my team to be voted leader, but I am more than ever aware that leadership includes allowing others to find their own leadership voice. I am going to be the guardrails on the side of the road, but I am not going to wrest away from another the desire to develop their own leadership abilities. I will continue to lead by positive reinforcement and the unabashed use of pastries and lunch to reward milestones met, while using suggestion and redirection in times of stress and confusion. One step, one breath at a time.</p>
