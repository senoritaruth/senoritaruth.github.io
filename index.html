		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
		<p>Hi, I'm Ruth. I help creatives establish their online identity and presence so they can participate in the creative economy to their fullest potential. I do so by deisnging websites and teaching about social media management. Have you ever purchased art from the artist from their website or through a social media post?

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Week 0</h3>
		<p>Orientiation was very interesting. I was happy to touch base with some of the faces behind the keyboard from the pre-work portion, and listen to everyone else's introduction. I like that we have students from a variety of backgrounds and with wildly different motivations for joining this experience.</p>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>The first week was grueling. I experienced some obstacles that were completely unexpected, but I have really enjoyed connecting with my peers. We're all very smart and funny, and I enjoy my classmates' contribution. I feel there is a lot of potential for us to help each other a lot, not only technically, but also in terms of motivation and follow-through. The AI talk on Friday was fun, and I liked the fact that it was lead by a CNM board member. </p>
